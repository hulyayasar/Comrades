Guess It! Is a multiplayer game with 3 different difficulty modes. On each mode, different settings and different rewards are being set. The rules are simple, try to guess the number as fast as possible. Now let's take a look at difficulty modes:
1) Easy: The range is from 0 to 50. The user has 100 seconds to make the best guess. For each second remaining the user will get 3 points.
2) Medium: The range is from 0 to 100. The user has 80 seconds to make the best guess. For each second reamining the user will get 6 points.
3) Hard: The range is from 0 to 150. The user has 60 seconds to make the best guess. For each second remaining the user will get 12 points.

On each try, the program will give hints (i.e. too low or too high). The username and points will be stored in Firebase Realtimedatabase, and these informations will be retrieved from the database in order to generate the leaderboard. 
Have Fun!
